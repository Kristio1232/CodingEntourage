Title of Project:

Random Icon Memorization

Our app will have 6 different icons. One of the icons will be randomly highlighted to indicate which must be chosen by the user. The user must then click on an among us character; it will be indicated which was chosen. It will either swap images or not swap images and flash green accompanied by a sound; the swapped image indicates selecting the incorrect shape and the green flash indicates selecting the correct icon. If it flashes green, the player will be able to continue selecting icons in the correct order that is randomly generated and if swapped, it will prompt a game over screen, show your score, and then give you the option to play again. 

There will be a highscore that is shown at the top of the screen along with a counter that displays how many rounds you have gone through to see how close you are to the high score. The top 5 highest scores will be kept along with the name that was entered when the score was recorded.
